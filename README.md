# Drowsiness_detection
 
# Features of Drowsiness detection
1.This project focuses on a drowsy detection Deep learning Model for prevention of road accidents because of this issue.
2.The objective of this  project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds.


# About the Project
In this Python project, we will be using OpenCV for gathering the images dataset provided and feed them into a Deep Learning model which will classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’.
The approach we will be using for this Python project is as follows :
- Take image as input from the data set provided.
- Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest (ROI).
– Detect the eyes from ROI and feed it to the classifier.
– Classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed.
– Calculate score to check whether the person is drowsy.
